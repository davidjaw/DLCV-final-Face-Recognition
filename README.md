# DLCV-final
Face Recognition

## Todos

### Implementation
- [ ] Implement baseline network with tensorflow
- [ ] Train baseline network with good performance
- [ ] Implement Squeezenext with tensorflow
- [ ] Train Squeezenext network (don't care about performance here)
- [ ] Implement Teacher-Student training strategy
- [ ] Train Squeezenext network under Teacher-Student policy **with better performance** than the typical one

### Presentation
- [ ] Don't know yet.
